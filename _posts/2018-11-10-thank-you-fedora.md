A few days ago it was Fedora's 15th anniversary. To celebrate this date, the [Fedora Community Operations Team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/) decided to organize the [Fedora Appreciation Week](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/appreciation-week/). This event happens on the week of November 6th to coincide with the [announcement of the project 15 years ago](https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2003-November/msg00000.html).

This week-long event celebrates the efforts of the Fedora Project contributors and it gives us an opportunity to share our thank you-s with the team. Appreciation can be anything, from an IRC message, a message on a mailing list, [Fedora Happiness Packets](https://happinesspackets.fedorainfracloud.org/) or a blog post, such as the one you're reading right now.

### My Thank You

My thank you to everyone in the Fedora Community is this blog post.

Thanks to all the Fedora team and to every amazing Open Source community that contributed on hundreds of projects that compose this fantastic free and open source operating system!

Thank you developers, QA-ers, DevOps engineers, **designers**, beta version testers, community members, volunteers, localizers, program managers and everyone else that helped the project during all these years.

Thank you all for being such a kind and welcoming community. I've felt very appreciated and **proud to be a Fedora Ambassador** 🎉  and representer.

### Fedora and I

I've been using Fedora as my main operating system for almost 3 years. So how did that happen? And why Fedora?

I had been using Windows exclusively (I had used Ubuntu Linux before) up until the moment that I first took part in events organized at [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc) in Tirana, Albania. I realized that there were more distros around and decided to try Fedora. My first installation was Fedora 22 and it went smoothly, so I decided to keep it installed.

Later on, I participated in some more Fedora events at the local community ([Localizations](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-translation-sprint-5-days-50-members-20-thousand-words/)) and then it grew onto me. Everyone was so **welcoming and helpful**, so I started using Fedora more and it became my preferred 💻  and default operating system (my favorite DE is [XFCE](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/xfce).

After contributing to the project, I decided to apply for the Ambassador position and was accepted. From the start I've been spreading the word about Fedora and organizing many events in the local hackerspace and not only, facilitated the involvement of Fedora at [OSCAL](https://oscal.openlabs.cc), our biggest early conference etc.

### Why Fedora

Fedora is a very polished, stable and secure Linux-based OS. With all its variants, like [Spins](https://spins.fedoraproject.org) and [Labs](https://labs.fedoraproject.org), I'm pretty sure there will be something for everyone. If you have never used it, I would suggest that you try it, regardless of your technical background. If you use another distro, I would recommend you to try Fedora 29.
