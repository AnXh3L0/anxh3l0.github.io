Software Freedom Kosova Conference. One of the biggest of its kind in the Balkans region. The seventh (7th) edition took place this time between 21-23 October, in Pristina, Kosovo. Based on my estimations, it gathered approximately two hundred participants.

I was present at SFK’16 as a maintainer of the LibreOffice infobooth and had a workshop named "LibreOffice Localization Sprint" altogether with Marinela Gogo. Many other Open Labs Hackerspace members were present at the conference.

My workshop was scheduled for Friday. It was an interactive showcase of the Pootle platform used to translate/localize LibreOffice and was attended by around fifteen (20) people. Most of them were students with an ICT background and showed interest. Italo Vignoli was also present at my workshop.

All in all, my presence in SFK’16 was a positive experience, although I was hoping the audience would have been larger and more diverse. Nevertheless, it is good to see the community growing.
