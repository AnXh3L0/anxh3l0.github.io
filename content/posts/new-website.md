For years, Iâ€™ve been using **Hugo** as my go-to static site generator. Itâ€™s fast, flexible, and makes maintaining a website incredibly easy. However, as my needs evolved, I wanted a **cleaner, more accessible, and SEO-friendly** setup. Thatâ€™s why I decided to rebuild my website - still using Hugo, but this time with **TailwindCSS** and improved accessibility features.  

## Why TailwindCSS?  

Previously, my Hugo theme relied on traditional CSS and some custom styling, which worked fine but became difficult to scale and maintain. With **TailwindCSS**, I now get:  

- **A utility-first approach** â€“ Faster development with reusable styles  
- **Better responsiveness** â€“ Simple, flexible grid and flexbox utilities  
- **Dark mode support** â€“ Built-in classes for theme switching  
- **Optimized performance** â€“ Only necessary styles are included, thanks to PurgeCSS integration  

## Enhancing Accessibility (a11y)  

One of my main goals was to ensure that my website is **usable for everyone**. This meant improving:  

- **ARIA landmarks** â€“ To help assistive technologies navigate the content more efficiently  
- **Better contrast and focus states** â€“ Ensuring elements are visible and usable  
- **Keyboard navigation** â€“ Making sure all interactive elements work smoothly  
- **Semantic HTML** â€“ Using the right elements for structure and meaning  

## SEO & Meta Improvements  

A website isnâ€™t just about looks; it also needs to be **discoverable**. I optimized my Hugo setup by:  

- Adding **dynamic meta tags** for social media previews  
- Structuring **Open Graph (OG) and Twitter Card metadata**  
- Improving **page speed** by optimizing images and scripts  
- Including **canonical URLs** to avoid duplicate content issues  

## Final Thoughts  

By combining **Hugo + TailwindCSS**, I now have a **lightweight, fast, and accessible** website that is easier to maintain. The new design reflects my focus on **performance, usability, and modern web standards**.
