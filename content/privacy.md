I respect the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this policy document explains how I collect and handle any information you provide to me.

## What background data is collected?

This site does not use any third party tracking scripts.\
I do not use any analytics software, apart from the in-built ones provided by Cloudflare which give a general idea of the total number of requests made to the site, but nothing more than that. No cookies nor any personal data is collected.

## How do I use the data you provide?

This website does not collect any other data.

## How secure is your data?

Very secure, as this website does not collect any information.

## How secure is this website?

This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider can still see that you are downloading assets from this site, but not its content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site.
