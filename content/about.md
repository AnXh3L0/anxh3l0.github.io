My name is Anxhelo Lushka, I'm a graphic designer and frontend developer, graduated in computer engineering and a heavy open source user and advocate. I contribute to FOSS projects, such as Fedora, LibreOffice, OpenStreetMap and [many more](https://github.com/AnXh3L0). I am a member of [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc/en), the first hackerspace in Albania, founded in 2012. I am also a Fedora Ambassador and a Document Foundation member.

In this website I will showcase my best works over time and some articles I write related to events I've organized/participated in, security and privacy in general, tips and tricks etc.

During the last 4 years I have organized tens of events and conferences such as [OSCAL](https://osc.al) (Open Source Conference Albania), [LibreOffice Conference](https://libocon.org) and more.
