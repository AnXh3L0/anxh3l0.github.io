{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/privacy-today.webp" link="https://t.me/privacytoday" title="Privacy Today" alt="Privacy Today Branding" caption="**Privacy Today** is an initiative where people talk about all things privacy, open source, libre philosophy and more! I created the main logo and some variations to represent their main groups; the eye in the logo stands for the current stance of the Internet where everything is under surveillance meanwhile the P stands for, you guessed it, 'Privacy'. You can join the channel by pressing the image above and the group by clicking [this link](https://t.me/privacytoday)." >}}
