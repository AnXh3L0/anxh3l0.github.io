{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/sirvpn.webp" title="SirVPN" alt="SirVPN Website" caption="**SirVPN** was an initiative and one of the first VPN-s based on the new protocol called [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/). The VPN was provided for free for the users (for a test drive period of 14 days) but has now shut down for lack of funding. I helped with the domain name, designed the website (as you might notice it's similar to the one you'll see below) and the logo, based on Indian symbols." >}}
