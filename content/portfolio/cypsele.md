{{< figure src="/media/images/portfolio/cypsele.webp" link="https://cypsele.fr/" title="Cypsele" alt="Cypsele Website" caption="Paris’ Ile Saint-Louis is set to welcome Cypsèle, the debut solo venture from Marcin Krol, whose star-studded résumé includes Borago in Chile, Paris' Maison and Norma. Krol’s aim is to create a 'hyperseasonal' menu, using fresh produce from microfarms across France. Diners can choose between a four- or seven-course tasting menu, where Krol serves proteins whole, cooked using traditional techniques over a wood-fired rotisserie oven. Expect crowd-pleasing dishes like sole stuffed with raw shrimp and sweetbreads baked in sourdough. Wines won't disappoint either, with an unbeatable selection curated by Quentin Loisel, Head Sommelier of Le Jules Verne." >}}
