{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/briar-styleguide.jpg" link="https://briar-styleguide.netlify.app" title="Briar Style Guide" alt="Briar Style Guide Website" caption="**Briar** is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn’t rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users’ devices. If the internet’s down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis. If the internet’s up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance. This website is a live style guide for the Briar brand, built using Hugo." >}}
