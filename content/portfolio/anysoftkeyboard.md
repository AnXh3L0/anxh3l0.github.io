{{< figure src="/media/images/portfolio/ask-website.webp" link="https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io" title="AnySoftKeyboard" alt="AnySoftKeyboard Website" caption="**AnySoftKeyboard** is an open source keyboard for Android devices. It has an active community on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard) and is available for Android 1.5 and up devices, so basically for every device possible. It is a private and fast alternative, weighning just 6.5MB, with over 40 supported languages. You can download the app from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard). I ran across this app a few weeks back and decided to contribute by designing a new website for them." >}}
