{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/adaway.webp" link="https://adaway.org" title="AdAway" alt="AdAway Website" caption="**AdAway** is an open source ad blocker for Android using the hosts file. Their website hadn't been updated since almost two years so I decided to give them a hand and update it using Jekyll and turning it into a visually more attractive site. The work included recreating the AdAway logo in SVG as it wasn't available anywhere and creating an import/export page for host files conversions." >}}
